# Best Practices

## 6️⃣ Best Practices

### Organizing Graphs

#### Naming Conventions
- **Graph Names:** Use descriptive names like "MainMenu_ButtonFade" or "Gameplay_PlayerDeath"
- **Node Names:** Keep node titles short but clear ("Fade In", "Play Sound", "Wait 2s")
- **Categories:** Use the built-in categories (UI, Camera, Cutscene, Gameplay, VFX, Misc)

#### File Organization
```
Assets/
├── AnimatixPro/
│   ├── UI/
│   │   ├── MainMenu_ButtonFade.asset
│   │   ├── Settings_PanelSlide.asset
│   │   └── Loading_ScreenTransition.asset
│   ├── Gameplay/
│   │   ├── Player_DeathSequence.asset
│   │   ├── Enemy_SpawnEffect.asset
│   │   └── PowerUp_Collection.asset
│   └── Cutscenes/
│       ├── Intro_CameraSweep.asset
│       └── Ending_CreditsRoll.asset
```

#### Graph Structure
- **Keep graphs focused** — One graph per specific animation sequence
- **Use clear flow** — Left to right, top to bottom
- **Group related nodes** — Keep similar animations together
- **Add comments** — Use node titles to document purpose

#### Version Control
- **Use meaningful commit messages** — "Add button hover animation" vs. "Updated graph"
- **Test before committing** — Ensure animations work correctly
- **Document changes** — Note what was modified and why

---

### Performance Optimization

#### Parallel Execution
- **Use parallel connections** — Run multiple animations simultaneously
- **Avoid unnecessary waits** — Only use Delay nodes when needed
- **Optimize timing** — Match animation durations to avoid gaps

#### Object Management
- **Reuse objects** — Don't create/destroy objects during animations
- **Pool particle systems** — Reuse particle effects
- **Cache references** — Store frequently accessed objects

#### Memory Optimization
- **Use object references** — Avoid string-based lookups
- **Clean up unused nodes** — Remove nodes that are no longer needed
- **Optimize textures** — Use appropriate texture sizes

#### Mobile Considerations
- **Limit particle effects** — Reduce particle counts on mobile
- **Use simpler animations** — Avoid complex multi-layered effects
- **Test on devices** — Always test on target hardware

### Using Animatix Pro in Different Contexts

#### UI Animations
- **Keep animations short** — 0.2-1.0 seconds for UI feedback
- **Use consistent timing** — Standardize animation durations
- **Provide visual feedback** — Always respond to user input
- **Test on different screen sizes** — Ensure animations work on all devices

#### 3D Scene Animations
- **Use world space** — For object movement in 3D scenes
- **Consider camera angles** — Ensure animations are visible
- **Optimize for performance** — Use simpler animations for distant objects
- **Test with different lighting** — Ensure animations work in all lighting conditions

#### Cutscene Animations
- **Plan the sequence** — Storyboard before creating animations
- **Use camera animations** — Create cinematic camera movements
- **Sync with audio** — Match animation timing to sound effects
- **Test playback speed** — Ensure animations work at different speeds

#### Gameplay Animations
- **Respond to game state** — Use triggers based on game events
- **Provide clear feedback** — Make animations communicate game state
- **Optimize for gameplay** — Don't let animations interfere with controls
- **Test with different players** — Ensure animations work for all skill levels

### Mobile & WebGL Considerations

#### Performance Limits
- **Reduce particle counts** — Use fewer particles on mobile
- **Simplify animations** — Avoid complex multi-layered effects
- **Use lower resolution** — Reduce texture sizes for mobile
- **Test on devices** — Always test on target hardware

#### Input Considerations
- **Touch-friendly** — Ensure animations work with touch input
- **Responsive design** — Adapt animations to different screen sizes
- **Battery optimization** — Avoid continuous animations that drain battery
- **Network optimization** — Minimize data usage for WebGL builds

#### Platform-Specific Features
- **Use platform defines** — Different animations for different platforms
- **Test on all platforms** — Ensure compatibility across devices
- **Optimize for each platform** — Use platform-specific optimizations
- **Handle platform differences** — Account for different capabilities

### Backup & Version Control Tips

#### Regular Backups
- **Save frequently** — Use Ctrl+S regularly
- **Create backups** — Keep copies of important graphs
- **Test backups** — Ensure backups work correctly
- **Document changes** — Note what was modified and why

#### Version Control
- **Use meaningful commit messages** — "Add button hover animation" vs. "Updated graph"
- **Test before committing** — Ensure animations work correctly
- **Document changes** — Note what was modified and why
- **Use branches** — Create branches for experimental features

#### Collaboration
- **Communicate changes** — Let team members know about modifications
- **Use consistent naming** — Follow team naming conventions
- **Document complex animations** — Explain how complex animations work
- **Test together** — Ensure animations work for all team members

#### Recovery
- **Keep old versions** — Don't delete old graph versions
- **Test recovery** — Ensure you can restore from backups
- **Document recovery process** — Know how to restore from backups
- **Have multiple backups** — Keep backups in different locations
