# Performance Optimization

## Parallel Execution
- **Use parallel connections** — Run multiple animations simultaneously
- **Avoid unnecessary waits** — Only use Delay nodes when needed
- **Optimize timing** — Match animation durations to avoid gaps

## Object Management
- **Reuse objects** — Don't create/destroy objects during animations
- **Pool particle systems** — Reuse particle effects
- **Cache references** — Store frequently accessed objects

## Memory Optimization
- **Use object references** — Avoid string-based lookups
- **Clean up unused nodes** — Remove nodes that are no longer needed
- **Optimize textures** — Use appropriate texture sizes

## Mobile Considerations
- **Limit particle effects** — Reduce particle counts on mobile
- **Use simpler animations** — Avoid complex multi-layered effects
- **Test on devices** — Always test on target hardware

## Using Animatix Pro in Different Contexts

### UI Animations
- **Keep animations short** — 0.2-1.0 seconds for UI feedback
- **Use consistent timing** — Standardize animation durations
- **Provide visual feedback** — Always respond to user input
- **Test on different screen sizes** — Ensure animations work on all devices

### 3D Scene Animations
- **Use world space** — For object movement in 3D scenes
- **Consider camera angles** — Ensure animations are visible
- **Optimize for performance** — Use simpler animations for distant objects
- **Test with different lighting** — Ensure animations work in all lighting conditions

### Cutscene Animations
- **Plan the sequence** — Storyboard before creating animations
- **Use camera animations** — Create cinematic camera movements
- **Sync with audio** — Match animation timing to sound effects
- **Test playback speed** — Ensure animations work at different speeds

### Gameplay Animations
- **Respond to game state** — Use triggers based on game events
- **Provide clear feedback** — Make animations communicate game state
- **Optimize for gameplay** — Don't let animations interfere with controls
- **Test with different players** — Ensure animations work for all skill levels
