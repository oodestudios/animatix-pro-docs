# Mobile & WebGL Considerations

## Performance Limits
- **Reduce particle counts** — Use fewer particles on mobile
- **Simplify animations** — Avoid complex multi-layered effects
- **Use lower resolution** — Reduce texture sizes for mobile
- **Test on devices** — Always test on target hardware

## Input Considerations
- **Touch-friendly** — Ensure animations work with touch input
- **Responsive design** — Adapt animations to different screen sizes
- **Battery optimization** — Avoid continuous animations that drain battery
- **Network optimization** — Minimize data usage for WebGL builds

## Platform-Specific Features
- **Use platform defines** — Different animations for different platforms
- **Test on all platforms** — Ensure compatibility across devices
- **Optimize for each platform** — Use platform-specific optimizations
- **Handle platform differences** — Account for different capabilities

## Backup & Version Control Tips

### Regular Backups
- **Save frequently** — Use Ctrl+S regularly
- **Create backups** — Keep copies of important graphs
- **Test backups** — Ensure backups work correctly
- **Document changes** — Note what was modified and why

### Version Control
- **Use meaningful commit messages** — "Add button hover animation" vs. "Updated graph"
- **Test before committing** — Ensure animations work correctly
- **Document changes** — Note what was modified and why
- **Use branches** — Create branches for experimental features

### Collaboration
- **Communicate changes** — Let team members know about modifications
- **Use consistent naming** — Follow team naming conventions
- **Document complex animations** — Explain how complex animations work
- **Test together** — Ensure animations work for all team members

### Recovery
- **Keep old versions** — Don't delete old graph versions
- **Test recovery** — Ensure you can restore from backups
- **Document recovery process** — Know how to restore from backups
- **Have multiple backups** — Keep backups in different locations
