# Loops & Variables

Master the art of creating dynamic, data-driven animations with loops and variables. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of loop control and variable management in Animatix Pro.

## üîÑ Loop System Fundamentals

Loops are essential for creating:
- **Repeating Animations** - Continuous or periodic effects
- **Data-driven Animations** - Animations that respond to changing data
- **Procedural Content** - Generated animations based on algorithms
- **Interactive Sequences** - User-controlled animation loops

### Loop Types
- **Count Loops** - Repeat a specific number of times
- **Condition Loops** - Repeat while a condition is true
- **Infinite Loops** - Repeat indefinitely until stopped
- **Nested Loops** - Loops within loops for complex patterns

## üî¢ Count Loops

### Basic Count Loop
Repeat animation a specific number of times.

#### Simple Count
```
Loop: Count
Iterations: 5
Action: Play animation
Result: Animation plays 5 times
```

#### Count with Delay
```
Loop: Count
Iterations: 3
Delay: 1.0 seconds
Action: Play animation
Result: Animation plays 3 times with 1-second delays
```

#### Count with Variation
```
Loop: Count
Iterations: 4
Variation: Random delay 0.5-1.5 seconds
Action: Play animation
Result: Animation plays 4 times with random delays
```

### Advanced Count Loops
More sophisticated counting mechanisms.

#### Count Down
```
Loop: Count Down
Start: 10
End: 0
Action: Play countdown animation
Result: Animation plays 10 times counting down
```

#### Count Up
```
Loop: Count Up
Start: 0
End: 100
Step: 10
Action: Play progress animation
Result: Animation plays 10 times counting up
```

#### Count Range
```
Loop: Count Range
Start: 5
End: 15
Step: 2

```

## üîÅ Condition Loops

### While Loops
Repeat while a condition is true.

```

### Do-While Loops
Execute at least once, then check condition.

#### Basic Do-While
```
Loop: Do-While
Action: Play animation
Condition: ShouldContinue
Result: Animation plays at least once, then continues if condition is true
```

```

### Controlled Infinite Loops
Infinite loops with external control.

#### Infinite with Stop Condition
```
Loop: Infinite
Action: Play animation
Stop Condition: User presses stop button
Result: Animation plays until user stops it
```

#### Infinite with Time Limit
```
Loop: Infinite
Action: Play animation
Time Limit: 300 seconds

```

#### Nested with Conditions
```
Outer Loop: While game is running
  Inner Loop: While player is alive
    Action: Play animation
Result: Animation plays while both conditions are true
```
