# Events & Actions

Master the event system to create responsive, interconnected animations that communicate and coordinate seamlessly. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of events and actions in Animatix Pro.

## ðŸŽ­ Event System Fundamentals

Events are the communication backbone of Animatix Pro, enabling:
- **Inter-Animation Communication** - Animations can trigger other animations
- **System Integration** - Connect with external systems and APIs
- **Real-time Coordination** - Synchronize multiple animation sequences
- **Dynamic Behavior** - Create adaptive, responsive animation systems

### Event Types
- **Animation Events** - Events related to animation lifecycle
- **System Events** - Events from Unity and external systems
- **Custom Events** - User-defined events for specific needs
- **Network Events** - Events for multiplayer and networked applications

## ðŸŽ¬ Animation Events

## ðŸŽ¨ Custom Events

### Event Definition
Creating custom events for specific needs.

#### Simple Event
```csharp
public class SimpleEvent : MonoBehaviour
{
    public UnityEvent OnCustomEvent;
    
    public void TriggerEvent()
    {
        OnCustomEvent.Invoke();
    }
}
```

#### Parameterized Event
```csharp
public class ParameterizedEvent : MonoBehaviour
{
    public UnityEvent<string> OnCustomEvent;
    
    public void TriggerEvent(string parameter)
    {
        OnCustomEvent.Invoke(parameter);
    }
}
```

#### Complex Event
```csharp
public class ComplexEvent : MonoBehaviour
{
    public UnityEvent<EventData> OnCustomEvent;
    
    public void TriggerEvent(EventData data)
    {
        OnCustomEvent.Invoke(data);
    }
}
```

### Event Broadcasting
Sending events to multiple listeners.

#### Direct Broadcasting
```csharp
public class EventBroadcaster : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void BroadcastEvent()
    {
        // Send to specific targets
        EventManager.Instance.SendEvent("CustomEvent", this);
    }
}
```

#### Global Broadcasting
```csharp
public class GlobalBroadcaster : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void BroadcastGlobalEvent()
    {
        // Send to all listeners
        EventManager.Instance.BroadcastEvent("GlobalEvent", this);
    }
}
```

#### Conditional Broadcasting
```csharp
public class ConditionalBroadcaster : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void BroadcastConditionalEvent()
    {
        if (ShouldBroadcast())
        {
            EventManager.Instance.SendEvent("ConditionalEvent", this);
        }
    }
}
```

## ðŸŽª Event-Action Patterns

### Event Chains
Sequences of events and actions.

#### Linear Chain
```
Event 1 â†’ Action 1 â†’ Event 2 â†’ Action 2 â†’ Event 3 â†’ Action 3
```

#### Branching Chain
```
Event 1 â†’ Action 1
    â”œâ”€â”€ Event 2A â†’ Action 2A
    â””â”€â”€ Event 2B â†’ Action 2B
```

#### Looping Chain
```
Event 1 â†’ Action 1 â†’ Event 2 â†’ Action 2 â†’ Event 1 (loop)
```

### Event Coordination
Coordinating multiple events and actions.

#### Synchronized Events
```
Event A: Start at time 0
Event B: Start at time 0
Event C: Start at time 0
Action: All events start simultaneously
```

#### Sequential Events
```
Event A: Start at time 0
Event B: Start at time 1
Event C: Start at time 2
Action: Events start in sequence
```

#### Conditional Events
```
Event A: Start if condition X
Event B: Start if condition Y
Event C: Start if condition Z
Action: Events start based on conditions
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Advanced Event Techniques

### Event Filtering
Filter events based on criteria.

#### Type Filtering
```
Filter: Only animation events
Action: Process only animation-related events
```

#### Source Filtering
```
Filter: Only events from specific source
Action: Process only events from that source
```

#### Parameter Filtering
```
Filter: Only events with specific parameters
Action: Process only events matching criteria
```

### Event Transformation
Transform events before processing.

#### Parameter Transformation
```
Input: Event with parameter A
Transform: Convert A to B
Output: Event with parameter B
```

#### Type Transformation
```
Input: Event of type X
Transform: Convert to type Y
Output: Event of type Y
```

#### Source Transformation
```
Input: Event from source A
Transform: Change source to B
Output: Event from source B
```

### Event Aggregation
Combine multiple events into one.

#### Time-based Aggregation
```
Input: Multiple events over time
Aggregate: Combine events within time window
Output: Single aggregated event
```

#### Count-based Aggregation
```
Input: Multiple events
Aggregate: Combine events until count reached
Output: Single aggregated event
```

#### Condition-based Aggregation
```
Input: Multiple events
Aggregate: Combine events until condition met
Output: Single aggregated event
```

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimization

### Event System Best Practices

#### Efficient Event Handling
- **Limit event frequency** to prevent spam
- **Use event pooling** for repeated events
- **Filter events early** to reduce processing
- **Profile event performance** regularly

#### Memory Management
- **Clean up unused event listeners** automatically
- **Use weak references** for event subscriptions
- **Limit event data size** to reduce memory usage
- **Monitor memory usage** during development

#### Platform Considerations
- **Mobile**: Simpler events, lower frequency
- **Desktop**: More complex events, higher frequency
- **Console**: Optimize for specific hardware
- **VR**: Consider event latency requirements

## ðŸ”§ Event Debugging

### Debug Tools
Built-in debugging features.

#### Event Inspector
- **View active events** in real-time
- **Monitor event frequency** and performance
- **Debug event flow** step by step
- **Log event data** for analysis

#### Event Profiler
- **Profile event performance** over time
- **Identify performance bottlenecks** in events
- **Optimize event handling** based on data
- **Monitor memory usage** of events

#### Event Logger
- **Log all events** to console
- **Export event logs** for analysis
- **Filter event logs** by type or source
- **Track event patterns** over time

### Common Issues

#### Event Not Firing
- Check if event listener is registered
- Verify event conditions are met
- Ensure event source is active
- Check for conflicting events

#### Performance Issues
- Reduce event frequency
- Simplify event handling
- Use event pooling
- Profile event performance

#### Logic Errors
