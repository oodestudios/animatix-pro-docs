## ðŸŽ¯ State Machines

### Finite State Machines
Classic state machine implementation.

#### State Definition
```csharp
public enum AnimationState
{
    Idle,
    Playing,
    Paused,
    Stopped
}
```

#### State Transitions
```csharp
public class StateMachine
{
    private AnimationState currentState;
    
    public void TransitionTo(AnimationState newState)
    {
        if (CanTransitionTo(newState))
        {
            currentState = newState;
            OnStateChanged(newState);
        }
    }
}
```

#### State Actions
```csharp
public void OnStateChanged(AnimationState newState)
{
    switch (newState)
    {
        case AnimationState.Idle:
            PlayIdleAnimation();
            break;
        case AnimationState.Playing:
            PlayCurrentAnimation();
            break;
        // ... other cases
    }
}
```

### Hierarchical State Machines
State machines with parent-child relationships.

#### Parent State
```
State: Player
Substates: Idle, Walking, Running, Jumping
Description: Main player state
```

#### Child States
```
State: Walking
Parent: Player
Substates: WalkSlow, WalkFast, WalkBackward

```

#### State Inheritance
```
State: Walking
Inherits: Player behavior
Adds: Walking-specific behavior
Overrides: Movement animations
```

## ðŸŽª State Synchronization

### Multi-Object States
Synchronizing states across multiple objects.

#### Master-Slave Pattern
```
Master: Player state
Slaves: Weapon state, UI state, Camera state
Synchronization: All slaves follow master state
```

#### Peer-to-Peer Pattern
```
Objects: Player, Enemy, Environment
Synchronization: All objects communicate state changes
```

#### Observer Pattern
```
Subject: State changes
Observers: Multiple objects watching for changes
Synchronization: Observers react to state changes
```

### State Persistence
Maintaining state across sessions.

#### Save State
```
State: Current animation state
Save: To file or database
Restore: On next session
```

#### State Serialization
```
State: Complex state object
Serialize: To JSON or binary format
Deserialize: On load
```

#### State Versioning
```
State: Version 1.0
Upgrade: To version 2.0
Migration: Convert old state to new format
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Advanced State Techniques

### State Blending
Smooth transitions between states.

#### Linear Blending
```
State A: Weight 0.7
State B: Weight 0.3
Result: 70% State A, 30% State B
```

#### Smooth Blending
```
State A: Weight 1.0 â†’ 0.0
State B: Weight 0.0 â†’ 1.0
Duration: 2.0 seconds
Result: Smooth transition over time
```

#### Multi-State Blending
```
State A: Weight 0.4
State B: Weight 0.3
State C: Weight 0.3
Result: Blended state from three sources
```

### State Prediction
Predicting future state changes.

#### Linear Prediction
```
Current State: Position A
Velocity: 10 units/second
Prediction: Position B in 1 second
```

#### Curve Prediction
```
Current State: Position A
Trajectory: Curved path
Prediction: Position B along curve
```

#### Machine Learning Prediction
```
Current State: Player behavior
Model: Trained ML model
Prediction: Likely next state
```

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimization

### State Management Best Practices

#### Efficient State Management
- **Minimize state changes** to reduce overhead

- Use state logging to trace execution
- Test state logic in isolation
- Verify state conditions and triggers

## ðŸŽ¯ Creative State Applications

Transition: Enemy defeated
Next State: Exploration Mode
```

#### Narrative States
```
State: Dialogue Active
Action: Play dialogue animations
Transition: Dialogue choice made
Next State: Choice Consequence
```

### Procedural Systems
Use states for procedural content.

#### Procedural Animation States
```
State: Idle
Action: Generate random idle animation
Transition: Timer expires
Next State: Idle (new animation)
```

#### Procedural UI States
```
State: Menu Layout
Action: Generate random menu layout
Transition: User preference change
Next State: Menu Layout (new layout)
```

#### Procedural Game States
```
State: Level Generation
