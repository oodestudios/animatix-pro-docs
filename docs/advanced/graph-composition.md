# Graph Composition (Nested Graphs)

**Graph composition** allows you to combine multiple graphs for complex sequences.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Create complex animations by combining multiple graphs

**Common Patterns:**

- **Nested Graphs:** One graph calls another
- **Graph References:** Reference graphs from other assets
- **Modular Design:** Break complex animations into smaller graphs

## Best Practices

- Use graph composition for modular design
- Keep graphs focused on specific tasks
- Document graph dependencies
- Test graph composition thoroughly
