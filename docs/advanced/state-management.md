**Common Patterns:**

- **State Variables:** Store animation state
- **State Transitions:** Switch between animation states
- **State Handlers:** Manage state changes
- **State Persistence:** Save and restore animation state

## Best Practices

- Use state variables for animation state
- Document state transitions
- Test state management thoroughly
- Consider state persistence for save/load
