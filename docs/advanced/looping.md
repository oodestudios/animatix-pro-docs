# Looping and Repeating Animations

**Looping** allows animations to repeat continuously instead of completing once.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Create continuous, repeating animations

**Loop Types:**

- **Simple Loop:** Repeats entire sequence
- **Ping-Pong Loop:** Plays forward, then reverse
- **Custom Loop:** User-defined loop logic

## Configuration

- **GraphExecutor Setting:** Enable "Loop Graph" in GraphExecutor component
- **Node-Level Looping:** Some animation nodes have built-in loop options
- **Manual Looping:** Connect last node back to trigger (advanced)

## Best Practices

- Use looping for continuous background animations
- Use ping-pong for breathing/pulsing effects
- Test looping for proper behavior
- Consider performance when using loops
