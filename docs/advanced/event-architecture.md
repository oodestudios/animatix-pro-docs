# Event-Driven Architecture

**Event-driven architecture** uses events to communicate between systems and trigger animations.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Create flexible, decoupled animation systems using events

**Common Patterns:**

- **Event Nodes:** Fire Unity Events when animations complete
- **Custom Events:** Trigger animations via event names
- **Event Handlers:** Listen for events and respond
- **Event Managers:** Centralized event management

## Best Practices

- Use events for decoupled systems
- Use descriptive event names
- Document event names used in your project
- Test event integration thoroughly
