### Supported Easing Curves

#### Linear
- **Description:** Constant speed, no acceleration
- **Use Case:** Mechanical movement, simple transitions
- **Formula:** y = x

#### Ease In
- **Description:** Slow start, fast finish
- **Use Case:** Natural acceleration, object falling
- **Formula:** y = x¬≤

#### Ease Out
- **Description:** Fast start, slow finish
- **Use Case:** Natural deceleration, object stopping
- **Formula:** y = 1 - (1 - x)¬≤

#### Ease In Out
- **Description:** Slow start and finish, fast middle
- **Use Case:** Most natural movement, smooth transitions
- **Formula:** y = x < 0.5 ? 2x¬≤ : 1 - 2(1 - x)¬≤

#### Ease In Back

### Keyboard Shortcuts & Tips

#### GraphFlow Editor
- **Right-click:** Open node creation menu
- **Drag:** Pan the graph view
- **Scroll:** Zoom in/out
- **Ctrl+Z:** Undo last action
- **Ctrl+Y:** Redo last action
- **Delete:** Remove selected nodes

- **Ctrl+C:** Copy values
- **Ctrl+V:** Paste values
- **F:** Focus on selected object

#### General Tips
- Use descriptive names for graphs and nodes
- Group related nodes together visually
- Test animations frequently during development
- Use parallel connections for simultaneous animations
- Keep animations short for better performance
- Use consistent timing across similar animations
- Test on target hardware for performance validation
- Document complex animations for team members
- Use version control for animation assets
- Backup important graphs regularly

#### Performance Tips
- Limit particle counts on mobile devices
- Use object pooling for frequently used objects
- Cache frequently accessed objects and components
- Optimize texture sizes for target platforms
- Test on actual hardware, not just the editor
- Use simpler animations for distant objects
- Avoid continuous animations that drain battery
- Profile performance regularly during development
