## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Concepts

### How the GraphFlow System Works

The GraphFlow System functions like a flowchart for animations.

Each "flow" represents a sequence of actions that happen in order (or in parallel).

### The Flow Concept

```
Trigger ‚Üí Animation ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Event
   ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì        ‚Üì
 Start    Fade In   Play Sound  Show UI
```

### Key Principles

1. **Nodes are Actions** ‚Äî Each node performs one specific operation
2. **Connections are Timing** ‚Äî Lines show the execution sequence
3. **Flow is Directional** ‚Äî Animation flows from left to right
4. **Parallel Execution** ‚Äî Multiple branches can run simultaneously

### Graph Structure

- **Start Point:** Usually a Trigger node (On Start, On Button Click, etc.)
- **Animation Nodes:** The main visual effects (Fade, Slide, Scale, etc.)
- **Action Nodes:** Side effects (Play Sound, Show Message, etc.)
- **Event Nodes:** Custom events for other systems
- **End Point:** Animation completes or loops back

**üì∏ [Screenshot Placeholder ‚Äì Example Graph Showing Flow from Trigger to Multiple Animations]**

## GraphExecutor ‚Äî How Animations Run

The GraphExecutor is the brain of Animatix Pro ‚Äî it reads your graph and executes animations in real time.

**Think of it as the conductor of an orchestra.**

### How It Works

1. **Graph Loading** ‚Äî Loads your assigned GraphFlow Asset
2. **Target Recognition** ‚Äî Automatically identifies the GameObject it's attached to
3. **Node Initialization** ‚Äî Prepares nodes with recognized target
4. **Trigger Detection** ‚Äî Waits for trigger conditions to be met
5. **Sequential Execution** ‚Äî Runs animations in connected order
6. **Parallel Processing** ‚Äî Handles two animation simultaneously
7. **Completion** ‚Äî Ends or loops the animation flow

### GraphExecutor Component

```csharp
// Main properties you'll use
public GraphFlowAsset GraphAsset;        // Your animation graph
public bool PlayOnStart = true;          // Auto-play when scene starts
public bool LoopAnimation = false;       // Repeat the animation
public float PlaybackSpeed = 1.0f;       // Speed multiplier
```

**üì∏ [Screenshot Placeholder ‚Äì GraphExecutor Inspector Showing Correct Settings]**
(Graph Asset assigned, Play On Start enabled, Loop Animation off, Playback Speed 1.0, auto-target recognition visible)

### Runtime Control

```csharp
// Start animation
GraphExecutorUtil.RunByName("MyAnimation");
// Stop animation
GraphExecutorUtil.StopByName("MyAnimation");

// Pause / Resume
GraphExecutorUtil.PauseByName("MyAnimation");
GraphExecutorUtil.ResumeByName("MyAnimation");

// Check status
bool isPlaying = GraphExecutorUtil.IsPlaying("MyAnimation");
float progress = GraphExecutorUtil.GetProgress("MyAnimation");
```

**üì∏ [Screenshot Placeholder ‚Äì GraphExecutor Component in Inspector (All Properties Displayed)]**

## Events & Actions System

The Events & Actions System lets you create interactive animations that react to player input and game state changes.

### Event Flow

```
Player Action ‚Üí Trigger Node ‚Üí Animation ‚Üí Action Node ‚Üí Event Node ‚Üí Automatic Event Response
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì            ‚Üì           ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
Button Click ‚Üí On Click ‚Üí Fade Out ‚Üí Play Sound ‚Üí Custom Event ‚Üí Event Manager handles automatically
```

### Automatic Event Management

- **Event Listeners:** Automatically created by the Event Manager
- **No Manual Setup:** No need to manually subscribe or unregister events
- **Event Manager:** Handles routing and listener management
- **System Integration:** Seamless connection with Unity's event system

### Built-In Triggers

| Trigger | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| On Start | Fires when scene begins | Auto-play animations |
| On Button Click | Fires when UI button is pressed | Interactive UI |
| On Key Press | Fires when specific key is pressed | Keyboard shortcuts |
| On Collision | Fires when objects collide | Physics-based triggers |

## Parallel Execution & Delays

Animatix Pro supports running multiple animations simultaneously, allowing for layered and synchronized effects.

### Parallel Execution

```
Trigger Node
     ‚Üì
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚Üí Animation A (Fade In)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Animation B (Slide In)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Animation C (Scale Up)
```

### Setting Up Parallel Animations

1. **Connect Multiple Branches** ‚Äî Drag from one node to multiple targets
2. **Enable Parallel Mode** ‚Äî Check Parallel With Previous in Animation nodes
3. **Sync Timing** ‚Äî Use Delay Nodes to align actions
4. **Control Flow** ‚Äî Combine with Condition Nodes for advanced logic

### Delay Control

| Delay Type | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Delay Before | Wait before starting | Pause 2 seconds, then fade |
| Delay After | Wait after completing | Fade out, then wait 1 second |
| Delay Between | Pause between animations | Fade ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Slide |
| Custom Timing | Precise control | Use Delay Nodes for exact timing |

### Real-World Example

```
On Button Click
     ‚Üì
Play Click Sound (immediate)
     ‚Üì
Fade Out Button (0.5s duration)
     ‚Üì
Wait 0.3 seconds
     ‚Üì
Slide In Next Screen (1.0s duration)
```

This creates a polished button interaction with audio feedback, smooth transitions, and properly timed pacing.
