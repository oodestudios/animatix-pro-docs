# Animatix Pro ‚Äî Complete Documentation

üéØ **Goal: "Get started in 5 minutes, master it in 30."**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started

### What Is Animatix Pro

Animatix Pro is Unity's most powerful visual animation system that lets you create complex, professional animations without writing a single line of code.

**Think of it as a visual programming language specifically designed for animations.**

**The Magic:**
- Instead of coding animations in scripts, you drag and connect nodes in a visual graph editor.
- Each node represents an action (like Fade In, Play Sound, or Wait 2 seconds), and you connect them to create complete animation sequences.

**Perfect For:**
- **Game Developers** ‚Äî UI animations, cutscenes, gameplay effects
- **Artists & Designers** ‚Äî No coding required, visual workflow
- **Indie Studios** ‚Äî Fast iteration, professional results
- **Mobile Games** ‚Äî Optimized performance, small file sizes

### Key Features & Why It's Different

**Visual Graph System**
- Drag-and-drop node-based workflow
- Real-time preview in the editor
- No coding knowledge required

**Performance Optimized**
- Built specifically for Unity's rendering pipeline
- Efficient memory usage
- Mobile and WebGL optimized

**Comprehensive Animation Types**
- **UI Animations:** Fade, Slide, Scale, Rotate, Color changes
- **Text Animations:** Typewriter effects, character-by-character reveals
- **3D Animations:** Object movement, camera controls, material changes
- **Audio Integration:** Sound triggers, volume tweens, pitch changes
- **Particle Systems:** Control emission rates, play/stop effects

**üîß Developer-Friendly**
- Full API access for runtime control
- Custom node creation support
- Integration with Unity Events
- ScriptableObject-based assets

**Artist-Friendly**
- Intuitive visual interface
- Real-time preview
- Preset system for common effects
- Non-destructive editing

## Installation

### 1. Import the Package
- Download Animatix Pro from the Unity Asset Store.
- Import the .unitypackage file into your project.
- Wait for Unity to process all assets.

### 2. Verify Installation
- Look for Animatix Pro in your Project window.
- Check that the Animatix Pro menu appears in Unity's top menu bar.
- Ensure no compilation errors in the Console.

### 3. First Setup
- Create a new scene or use an existing one.
- Add a GameObject to your scene (this will be your animation target).
- Add the GraphExecutor component to it.
- **Important:** The GraphExecutor automatically recognizes the GameObject it's attached to as the animation target.

## Quick Start: Your First Animation

Let's create a simple button fade-in animation in under 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Create the Graph
1. Right-click in the Project Window ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Animatix Pro ‚Üí GraphFlow Asset
2. Name it `ButtonFadeIn`
3. Double-click to open the GraphFlow Editor

**üì∏ [Screenshot Placeholder ‚Äì Creating a New GraphFlow Asset]**

### Step 2: Add Nodes
1. Right-click in the graph ‚Üí Add Node ‚Üí Trigger ‚Üí On Start
2. Right-click again ‚Üí Add Node ‚Üí Animation ‚Üí Fade
3. Right-click again ‚Üí Add Node ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Play Animation
4. Drag from the On Start node's output port to the Fade node's input port.

### Step 3: Configure the Animation
1. Select the Fade node.
2. In the Inspector, set:
   - **Duration:** 1.0 seconds
   - **Fade Start:** 0 (invisible)
   - **Fade End:** 1 (fully visible)
   - **Easing:** Ease In Out
