## What Is Animatix Pro

Animatix Pro is Unity's most powerful visual animation system that lets you create complex, professional animations without writing a single line of code.

:::tip Visual Programming
Think of it as a visual programming language specifically designed for animations. Instead of coding animations in scripts, you drag and connect nodes in a visual graph editor.
:::

**The Magic:**
- Instead of coding animations in scripts, you drag and connect nodes in a visual graph editor.
- Each node represents an action (like Fade In, Play Sound, or Wait 2 seconds), and you connect them to create complete animation sequences.

:::info Who Is This For?
