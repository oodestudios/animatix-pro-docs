## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Import Errors**
If you see import errors:
1. Make sure you're using Unity 2021.3 LTS or later
2. Check that all required dependencies are installed
3. Try reimporting the package

#### **Missing Dependencies**
Animatix Pro requires:
- Unity UI (uGUI)
- TextMeshPro (for text animations)
- Cinemachine (for camera animations)

These are usually included with Unity, but if you see missing references:
1. Go to `Window > Package Manager`
2. Install missing packages from the Unity Registry

#### **Performance Issues**
If you experience performance issues:
1. Check the `GraphExecutor` settings
2. Reduce the number of simultaneous animations
3. Use the performance profiler to identify bottlenecks
