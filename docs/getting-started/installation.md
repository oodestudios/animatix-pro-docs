# Installation

## 1. Import the Package

- Download Animatix Pro from the Unity Asset Store.
- Import the .unitypackage file into your project.
- Wait for Unity to process all assets.

## 2. Verify Installation

- Look for Animatix Pro in your Project window.
- Check that the Animatix Pro menu appears in Unity's top menu bar.
- Ensure no compilation errors in the Console.

## 3. First Setup

- Create a new scene or use an existing one.
- Add a GameObject to your scene (this will be your animation target).
- Add the GraphExecutor component to it.
- **Important:** The GraphExecutor automatically recognizes the GameObject it's attached to as the animation target.
