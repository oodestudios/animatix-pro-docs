Control Unity's particle systems directly through animation nodes.

**Play Particles / Stop Particles / Loop Particles / Emission Rate Tween / Simulate Particles**

## Example Use Cases
- On Explosion → Play Particles (2 s) → Stop Particles → Wait (1 s)
- On Start → Loop Particles (infinite) → Emission Rate Tween Up (3 s)
