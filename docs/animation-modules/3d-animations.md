# 3D Object Animations

Bring 3D objects to life with smooth transformations and cinematic motion.

## Transform Animations
**Move 3D | Move Local 3D | Rotate 3D | Scale 3D | Look At 3D**

Each includes duration, easing, and world/local space control.

## Example Use Cases
- On Start → Move 3D Camera (3 s) → Look At Target (1 s)
- On Trigger → Scale 3D Object (0.5 s) → Rotate 3D (1 s)
