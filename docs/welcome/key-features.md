# Key Features & Why It's Different

Animatix Pro bridges **the simplicity of visual design** with **the depth of professional animation control.**

Here's what sets it apart:

## Visual Graph System — Animate Visually

Unlike traditional timeline tools or hardcoded scripts, Animatix Pro uses a **node-based graph** to build animations visually and logically.

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **Drag & Connect Nodes** | Build animation flow visually |
| **Instant Preview** | Test results live in the Editor |
| **Clear Flow Visualization** | Understand logic at a glance |
| **Non-Destructive Editing** | Modify freely, never lose work |

*The GraphFlow editor — every animation represented as connected actions.*

## Built for Speed and Efficiency

Performance drives everything in Animatix Pro.

From desktop to mobile, every system is optimized for real-time gameplay.

| Optimization | Benefit |
|--------------|---------|
| **Native Unity Integration** | Works seamlessly with Unity's pipeline |
| **Memory Efficient** | Lightweight, non-bloating runtime |
| **Mobile Optimized** | Runs smoothly on iOS, Android, and WebGL |
| **Cross-Platform Ready** | Same performance everywhere |

*Engineered for stability and speed on all targets.*

## Complete Animation Toolkit

One system — **infinite creative possibilities.**

**Animation Modules:**

| **Module** | **Example Capabilities** |
|------------|--------------------------|
| **UI Animations** | Fade, Move, Scale, Rotate, Bounce, Impact |
| **Text Animations** | Typewriter, Reveal, Scramble, Character Effects |
| **3D Object Animations** | Move, Rotate, Scale, Transform |
| **Camera Animations** | Zooms, Shakes, Follows, Orbits |
| **Audio Integration** | Volume, Pitch, Play/Stop controls |
| **Material Animations** | Color, Property, Shader transitions |
| **Particle Control** | Emission, playback, and triggers |

With every animation type unified under one editor, you can mix them freely — UI with audio, text with particles, cameras with VFX — all from one graph.

## Developer-Friendly Foundation

**Visual power meets technical control.**

Developers can extend, automate, or integrate Animatix Pro seamlessly into custom pipelines.

**Technical Capabilities:**

- **Full API Access** — Integrate and trigger via `GraphExecutorUtil` for complete runtime control
- **Custom Node Creation** — Extend the system with your own logic, triggers, or effects
- **Unity Events Integration** — Seamless connection with Unity's event system
- **ScriptableObject Assets** — Professional, source-control-safe data format

Developers can extend and control any animation while keeping full visual authoring flexibility.

## Artist-First Workflow

Creativity comes first.

Every panel, field, and node in Animatix Pro is designed to feel *natural* to artists and intuitive to non-programmers.

**Design Principles:**

- **Zero Coding Required** — Complete visual authoring workflow
- **Clean, Unity-Styled Interface** — Familiar Unity conventions throughout
- **Quick Presets & Templates** — Jump-start common animation patterns
- **Real-Time Feedback** — See results immediately, no Play Mode needed

Bring your motion to life — instantly and intuitively.
