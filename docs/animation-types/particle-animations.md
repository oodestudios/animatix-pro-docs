## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Particle Animation Best Practices

#### Optimize for Performance
- **Limit particle count** (max 1000-2000 per system)
- **Use efficient emission rates** for smooth performance
- **Test on target devices** regularly
- **Profile particle performance** during development

#### Memory Management
- **Disable unused particle systems** when not needed
- **Use particle pooling** for repeated effects
- **Limit complex effects** on mobile devices
- **Profile memory usage** during development

#### Platform Considerations
- **Mobile**: Simpler effects, lower particle counts
- **Desktop**: More complex effects, higher particle counts
- **Console**: Optimize for specific hardware
- **VR**: Consider frame rate requirements

## üéØ Common Particle Patterns

### Visual Effects Patterns
- **Explosion effects** for impacts and destruction
- **Magic effects** for spells and abilities
- **Environmental effects** for atmosphere
- **UI effects** for interface feedback

### Gameplay Patterns
- **Hit effects** for combat feedback
- **Power-up effects** for collectibles
- **Trail effects** for movement
- **Aura effects** for status effects

### Cinematic Patterns
- **Atmospheric effects** for mood setting
- **Transition effects** for scene changes
- **Dramatic effects** for story moments
- **Background effects** for ambiance

## üîß Troubleshooting Particle Animations

### Common Issues

#### Particles Not Spawning
- Check if particle system is enabled
- Verify the GraphFlow Asset is assigned
- Ensure emission rate is greater than 0
- Check for conflicting animations

#### Performance Issues
- Reduce particle count
- Use simpler emission patterns
- Optimize particle properties
- Test on target devices

#### Visual Glitches
- Check for overlapping particle systems
- Verify particle material settings
- Ensure proper lighting
- Test on different screen sizes

### Debug Tips
- **Use Debug Mode** to see particle execution
- **Add breakpoints** for complex sequences
- **Log particle events** for troubleshooting
- **Test incrementally** to isolate issues
