## ðŸš€ Performance Optimization

### 3D Animation Best Practices

#### Optimize for Performance
- **Use LODs** for distant objects
- **Limit simultaneous animations** (max 20-30)
- **Use efficient easing curves** for smooth motion
- **Test on target devices** regularly

#### Memory Management
- **Disable unused animations** when not needed
- **Use object pooling** for repeated effects
- **Limit particle effects** on mobile devices
- **Profile memory usage** during development

#### Platform Considerations
- **Mobile**: Simpler animations, lower object counts
- **Desktop**: More complex animations, higher object counts
- **Console**: Optimize for specific hardware
- **VR**: Consider frame rate requirements

## ðŸŽ¯ Common 3D Animation Patterns

### Gameplay Patterns
- **Pickup animations** for collectibles
- **Door animations** for interactive elements
- **Platform animations** for moving objects
- **Effect animations** for visual feedback

### Cinematic Patterns
- **Camera movements** for dramatic effect

- **Holographic effects** for futuristic UIs
- **Depth-based navigation** for complex menus
- **Spatial interactions** for touch interfaces

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting 3D Animations

### Common Issues

#### Animation Not Playing
- Check if object has required components
- Verify the GraphFlow Asset is assigned
- Ensure object is active and visible
- Check for conflicting animations

#### Performance Issues
- Reduce number of animated objects
- Use simpler easing curves
- Optimize particle effects
- Test on target devices

#### Visual Glitches
