- **Test on target devices** regularly
- **Profile camera performance** during development

#### Memory Management
- **Disable unused cameras** when not needed
- **Use camera pooling** for dynamic cameras
- **Limit post-processing effects** on mobile
- **Profile memory usage** during development

#### Platform Considerations
- **Mobile**: Simpler camera movements, lower quality
- **Desktop**: More complex movements, higher quality
- **Console**: Optimize for specific hardware
- **VR**: Consider frame rate requirements

## üéØ Common Camera Patterns
